		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>
			Chennai Anime Club is a community for fans of anime, manga, and Japanese culture in and around
			Chennai. We host meet-ups, events, conventions, and movie screenings, as well as online
			discussions through WhatsApp and Discord.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our mission is to create a welcoming space for everyone — whether you're new to anime or a
			long-time fan. We connect, share recommendations, discuss the latest episodes, and celebrate
			the fandom together.
		</p>
		<p>
			We’re run entirely by volunteers who are passionate about building this community. If you’d
			like to contribute, join our events, or collaborate with us, check out the
