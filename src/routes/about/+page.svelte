	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>
		Chennai Anime Club is a community for fans of anime, manga, and Japanese culture in and around
		Chennai. We host meet-ups, events, conventions, and movie screenings, as well as online
		discussions through WhatsApp and Discord.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our mission is to create a welcoming space for everyone — whether you're new to anime or a
		long-time fan. We connect, share recommendations, discuss the latest episodes, and celebrate the
		fandom together.
	</p>
	<p>
		We’re run entirely by volunteers who are passionate about building this community. If you’d like
		to contribute, join our events, or collaborate with us, check out the
